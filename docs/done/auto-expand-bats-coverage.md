# Expand bats coverage

- [x] **Expand bats coverage** — Added 11 new tests across two files: `tests/adr-guard.bats` (7 tests — verifies the PostToolUse ADR guard exits 0 on clean/excluded paths and exits 2 with the correct message when a rejected term such as "minio" appears in a guarded file) + 4 uptime-math edge cases in `tests/bluegreen-probe.bats` (all-failures → 0%, single-pass, single-fail, and the outage-uses-maxrun-not-fail-count invariant). Suite grows from 15 to 26 tests. (auto/expand-bats-coverage)
