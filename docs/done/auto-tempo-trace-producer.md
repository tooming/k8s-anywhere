# Real Tempo trace producer — swap `hello` demo to HotROD

- [x] **Real Tempo trace producer — swap `hello` demo to HotROD** — Replaced `nginx:alpine` in `gitops/apps/demo/deployment.yaml` with `jaegertracing/example-hotrod:latest`; added `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://tempo.observability.svc.cluster.local:4318`. Updated `docs/dependency-tree.md` to show the `hello → tempo` OTLP edge (removed the "no producer yet" placeholder). Updated the "Lab — Traces" Grafana dashboard About panel to document HotROD as the trace producer with example TraceQL queries. (auto/tempo-trace-producer)
